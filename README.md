WIP for a map location tracker to help with Rabi Ribi rando.

Feel free to download the files and run index.html locally or use the
gitpage for it at https://allibear17.github.io/Rabi-ribi-Rando-Mobile-Friendly/
or the newer (less mobile friendly version at)
https://allibear17.github.io/Rabi-Ribi-Rando-Tracker/

All item locations should be marked with a transparent white square. 
Left click AND right click cycle the marker icons. A debug tooltip is 
left in, showing "marker#" in the top left. Please use this to refer 
to incorrect data.

If you would like to help feedback, corrections or improvements are welcome.
